## Resource Management and Economics

1. Declare all of Earth's resources as the common heritage of all people, not just a select few.
2. Base decisions on resource availability and carrying capacity, not monetary profit.
3. Eliminate the monetary system, as it creates artificial scarcity and perpetuates inequality.
4. Measure a nation's wealth by its resources and productive capacity, not by accumulated money.
5. Use technology and automation to create abundance for all rather than scarcity for profit.
6. Design production systems to meet human needs directly without exchange mediums like money, barter, or credit.
7. Apply scientific methods to resource allocation rather than market mechanisms.
8. Automate all routine and monotonous labor to free humans for creative pursuits.
9. Maintain real-time inventory systems using electronic sensors throughout society.
10. Produce goods for maximum utility and durability, not planned obsolescence.

## Environment and Sustainability

11. Prioritize environmental restoration and protection as essential to human survival.
12. Design all systems to operate within Earth's carrying capacity.
13. Use only clean, renewable energy sources including solar, wind, geothermal, and thermal energy.
14. Eliminate the use of dangerous chemicals and pesticides in agriculture.
15. Create circular cities that minimize resource waste and maximize efficiency.
16. Integrate parks, gardens, and green spaces throughout urban environments.
17. Build structures to withstand natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes.
18. Use prefabricated, modular construction methods to conserve resources.
19. Implement closed-loop systems where waste from one process becomes input for another.
20. Monitor soil conditions, water tables, and nutrients automatically without human intervention.

## Science and Decision-Making

21. Apply the scientific method to social systems and decision-making.
22. Base all decisions on careful research and experimentation, not opinions.
23. Require verification and peer review for all proposed solutions.
24. Ask "what do we have here?" and investigate through systematic inquiry.
25. Replace political ideologies with technical problem-solving approaches.
26. Use computers and artificial intelligence to manage complex systems beyond human capacity.
27. Eliminate decision-making based on financial influence and control.
28. Design systems that serve all people equally, not particular advantage groups.
29. Continuously update methodologies based on new information and changing conditions.
30. Assign more decision-making to machines as technology develops.

## Education and Human Development

31. Make education free and accessible to all without restrictions.
32. Teach critical thinking and the scientific method rather than indoctrination.
33. Emphasize cooperation, creativity, and individuality over uniformity.
34. Provide information about how environment shapes human behavior and values.
35. Eliminate elitism of all types, including technical and academic elitism.
36. Design education to prepare people for continuous change, recognizing there are no final frontiers.
37. Foster global consciousness and planetary thinking rather than nationalism.
38. Train people to be problem-solvers, not soldiers or "killing machines".
39. Teach children through demonstration and films showing how systems interconnect.
40. Encourage wide-ranging innovative thinking free from political and religious constraints.

## Human Behavior and Values

41. Understand that human behavior is shaped by environment, not fixed "human nature".
42. Recognize that greed, prejudice, bigotry, and hatred are learned behaviors, not innate traits.
43. Change destructive behaviors by changing the environment that produces them.
44. Reject notions of inherent good and evil; understand behavior as environmentally determined.
45. Abandon the concept of "individuality" as a myth; recognize we are products of our culture.
46. Accept that intelligence and abilities result from environmental conditions and opportunities.
47. Understand that violence, poverty, and crime stem from scarcity, not "human nature".
48. Celebrate being proven wrong as elevation to a new level of understanding.
49. Base success on pursuing what you genuinely believe in, not cultural definitions of wealth.
50. Practice empathy by understanding where others are coming from based on their environment.

## Social Organization and Governance

51. Eliminate all forms of government based on politics, replacing them with scientific management.
52. Remove police, military, prisons, and navies as unnecessary in a society of abundance.
53. End all wars by addressing their root causes: scarcity and resource competition.
54. Abolish national borders and create one unified global civilization.
55. Eliminate taxation, as resources are managed collectively.
56. Remove all forms of debt and servitude from society.
57. Make laws and regulations obsolete by designing environments that prevent problems.
58. Establish values that coincide with actual human needs and environmental sustainability.
59. Ensure no group holds power or advantage over others.
60. Design social systems where individual and collective interests align mutually.

## Technology and Innovation

61. Use technology to generate abundance and eliminate scarcity wherever possible.
62. Implement cybernation—the wedding of computers to production systems.
63. Apply artificial intelligence that simulates and improves upon human decision-making.
64. Create interconnected electronic sensors throughout all social systems.
65. Develop automated inventory systems that order materials well in advance.
66. Design cities as evolving organisms that accommodate change, not static structures.
67. Build transportation systems above ground for maximum efficiency.
68. Prefabricate buildings in factories like automobiles on assembly lines.
69. Use 3D imaging and advanced construction techniques for rapid building.
70. Create self-erecting structures that require minimal manual labor.

## Resource Distribution and Access

71. Provide universal access to all necessities: food, housing, clothing, medical care, education.
72. Ensure the highest possible standard of living for all people on Earth.
73. Eliminate hunger, poverty, and homelessness through intelligent resource management.
74. Make medical care available to everyone without cost or barriers.
75. Provide challenges that stimulate the mind while meeting material needs.
76. Design systems where the smarter everyone becomes, the richer society is.
77. Recognize that your safety depends on everyone else's wellbeing.
78. Understand that unmet needs in others create dangers for all.
79. Allocate resources to where they are needed without creating waste.
80. Eliminate the hoarding of resources by ensuring universal access.

## Urban Design and Infrastructure

81. Build circular cities with radial sectors for maximum efficiency.
82. Place a central dome housing cybernated systems, education, health, and communications.
83. Surround cities with agricultural belts using hydroponic and aeroponic methods.
84. Create waterways for irrigation and filtration around agricultural zones.
85. Designate outer perimeters for recreation including golf, hiking, biking, and water sports.
86. Design residential districts with varied architecture immersed in landscaping.
87. Build vertical cities (skyscrapers) to preserve land for parks and wilderness.
88. Include all amenities within walking distance to eliminate automobile dependency.
89. Make exercise naturally incorporated through city design, not imposed rules.
90. Create shallow pools and safe recreational facilities designed to prevent accidents.

## Cooperation and Global Unity

## Summary

These rules synthesize Jacque Fresco's vision of a **resource-based economy** where scientific methodology, technological abundance, environmental stewardship, and understanding of human behavior converge to create a sustainable, equitable civilization free from war, poverty, and unnecessary suffering.

## About The Venus Project

The Venus Project is an organization founded by futurist Jacque Fresco that proposes an alternative vision of what the future can be if we apply what we already know in order to achieve a sustainable new world civilization. It calls for a straightforward redesign of our culture in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger, debt, and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but as totally unacceptable.
